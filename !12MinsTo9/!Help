12 Mins to 9 is a version of the popular 2048 puzzle game that
runs in the RISC OS desktop. It is based on the original by
Gabriele Cirulli.


System requirements
-------------------
This game should run on RISC OS 3.1 or later. RISC OS 3.1 users
who are not running the nested Window Manager will need the
BorderUtils module, supplied with !NewLook or as part of
PlingSystem on the RISC OS Open website.

A 256-colour mode or better is recommended for the best
appearance.


How to play
-----------
When run, the !12MinsTo9 icon installs on the icon bar. Click
SELECT or ADJUST on the icon to launch a new game.

The game is played on a 4x4 grid. The game starts with two
random tiles with a value of 2 or 4 placed on the grid.

Slide the tiles left, right, up or down using the arrow buttons
in the game window. Alternatively, click in the window to gain
input focus, and you can use the keyboard cursor keys to move.

The tiles will slide as far as they can go in the direction you
choose. They will only stop if they collide with another tile
or the edge of the grid.

If two tiles of the same value collide, they will merge into
one tile with the combined value of the two previous tiles. The
value of the merged tile will be added to your score. See
"Merging tiles" below for more on this.

After every move, a new tile will be added to the grid, if
there is room for it. There is a 90% chance of the tile being a
2, or a 10% chance of a 4.

The aim of the game is to progressively combine tiles to get
larger and larger numbers, until you reach the 2048 tile. The
secondary aim is to score as many points as possible.

The game ends when there are no further legal moves. This
occurs when the grid is completely full and there are no
adjacent tiles of the same value that can be merged.

It is possible to undo your previous move by clicking the Undo
button in the game window. Only one move can be undone, but you
can undo even after Game Over occurs.

You can close the main window and the game will stay active. To
start a new game from scratch, click Menu on the icon bar icon
and choose "New game".


Merging tiles
-------------
There are some subtleties to the tile merging you need to be
aware of.

Tiles can only merge once per turn. So for example, if you have
a row of tiles as shown below...

+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  2  |  2  |  2  |  2  |
+-----+-----|-----+-----+
 
...sliding to the right will produce:

+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |  4  |  4  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Note that the two pairs of 2s merge, but the resulting pair of
4s will not merge. Of course, on the next turn you can slide
again to merge them.

The order that tiles merge depends on the direction you slide.
So with these tiles:

+-----+-----+-----+-----+
+  8  |  8  |  8  |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Sliding to the right gives:      Sliding to the left would give:

+-----+-----+-----+-----+        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |     |  8  |  16 |        |  16 |  8  |     |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+        +-----+-----+-----+-----+
(the two rightmost tiles merge)  (the two leftmost tiles merge)

Of course, similar rules apply for sliding up and down.
