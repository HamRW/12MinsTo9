12MinsTo9 is a clone of the popular 2048 game designed to run in the RISC OS desktop.

The BASIC code is saved as text in order to be viewable on the GitHub website.

To build you will need Steve Fryatt's Tokenize from https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/tokenize (or, if you're not bothered about source code formatting, just load into BASIC with the TEXTLOAD command and save out)

To build the crunched version you will additionally need Steve Drain's !Crunchie app from http://kappa.me.uk/download.htm

The obey files !MkTest and !MkCrunched will build a tokenised or crunched version of the !RunImage

!MkRelease additionally will create a Zip of a full application ready to be installed.
